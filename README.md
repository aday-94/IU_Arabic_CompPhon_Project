II. Project Description:

    1. What your application does,
    
    ***Rough Outline***

The purpose of our research is: 1) to take any Orthographic, Arabic text ; 2) Use our patented pre-processing method to convert the entire Orthographic text to its IPA representation + applied a phonological rule (gemination) in the pre-processing based on the orthographic shaddah character in Arabic, so, that we could produce the correct IPA representation of the Orthographic words -- this is our pre-Silver Standard ; 3) Then we created our Silver Standard from the last step's output via applying emphasis spreading (emphatic vowel harmony & emphatic liquid harmony) which means that if an emphatic phoneme (list them here) occurred within a word, any vowels in that word became uvularized and any liquids (l r) in that word became emphatic ; 4)
