# Collection of Arabic Processing Utilities

Includes:

- Arabic Diacritizer (Tries to guess diacritization of word using dictionary)
- Arabic to IPA Converter (Converts diacritized Arabic to International Phonetic Alphabet Unicode)
- Arabic filter (Deletes non-arabic terms)

They can all be run with `python [script_name]`. Mostly they read from STDIN and write to STDOUT
but they can all be run with `--help` to see exact documentation.
